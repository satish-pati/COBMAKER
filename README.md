COBMAKER is an innovative, browser-based learning environment designed to teach COBOL—a foundational legacy programming language—using modern visual programming principles. Targeted at novice programmers and those transitioning into legacy system maintenance, COBMAKER leverages intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, hierarchical section visualizations, and real-time code generation to bridge the gap between modern learning styles and the structured syntax of COBOL.

COBVIS transforms traditionally tedious COBOL education into an engaging, interactive experience. Inspired by the success of visual programming platforms like Scratch and Blockly, COBMAKER is the first comprehensive visual learning platform built specifically for COBOL, empowering the next generation of developers to sustain and innovate on critical legacy infrastructure.
